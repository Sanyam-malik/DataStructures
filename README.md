# Data Structures Practice Project

Welcome to the Data Structures Practice Project! This project is designed to help you improve your understanding and implementation skills of various data structures commonly used in programming.

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll find a collection of data structure implementations and related exercises. Each data structure is organized into its own directory, containing the implementation, usage examples, and practice exercises. The goal is to learn how these data structures work and how to apply them effectively in different scenarios.

## Data Structures

### Linked List

Learn about linked lists and their variations such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. Implement common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Stack

Understand stacks and their LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) behavior. Implement push, pop, and peek operations. Explore use cases like expression evaluation and backtracking algorithms.

### Queue

Explore queues with their FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior. Implement enqueue, dequeue, and front operations. Learn about priority queues and applications in breadth-first search.

### Binary Tree

Dive into binary trees and their traversal methods like in-order, pre-order, and post-order. Implement binary search trees and practice common operations like insertion, deletion, and searching.

### Hash Table

Study hash tables and their collision resolution techniques. Implement basic hash functions, handle collisions with chaining or open addressing, and understand hash table performance.

### Graph

Discover graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list) and traversal algorithms (depth-first search, breadth-first search). Implement these algorithms and solve graph-based problems.
